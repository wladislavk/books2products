# books2products
Short Wordpress plugin for dealing with meta properties of custom product types.

Suppose you have a Woocommerce shop and you want to extend it so that each product would have multiple product pages, that should belong to a custom post type or types. Then you want to be able to fetch the custom post type metadata (e.g. custom fields) for a specific product. This is how this simple plugin appeared. Now it supports only the specifics of the project it was built for, but it could be extended for general use.
